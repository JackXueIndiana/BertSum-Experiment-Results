# BertSum-Experiment-Results
This repo is to host the artifacts gathered from a number of experiments in training and testing with BertSum (https://github.com/nlpyang/BertSum) in different configurations.

Based on https://paperswithcode.com/sota/document-summarization-on-cnn-daily-mail , BertSum is the most advanced NLP model for Extractive and Abstractive Summarization of text, based on Google Languageâ€™s BERT pretrained model.

I am trying to fine tune this model to generate short summaries from technical document, say, Azure docs.
